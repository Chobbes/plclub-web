title: "Verifying Neural Networks with Reluplex"
speaker: "Steve Hsu"

Neural networks are being used in safety-critical
applications. In this setting, we want guarantees about the behavior
of these neural networks. I will talk about a tool called Reluplex,
which verifies properties of neural networks. It can perform this
verification when the neural network uses the ReLU as the activation
function of its neurons and the property is stated in terms of
piecewise linear constraints on the input and output values of the
network.

Here is a link to Guy Katz's website, which has a brief description of Reluplex.
