I'll be talking a bit about undefined behaviour and compilers. It should be a fairly introductory talk, but if you want to be ahead of the curve, John Regehr has some fun blog posts on UB:

Also if you prefer, here's a short post about how UB can get a little crazy:

At the end of the talk I hope to talk a little bit about how we're handling some of this (and undef and poison) in the semantics of Vellvm, assuming all goes well with the preparation and the timing works out :).
