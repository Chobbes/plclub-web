<h1>Metatheory library</h1>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">The Penn PLClub has developed, and
  continues to work on, a collection of Coq libraries for mechanizing
  programming language metatheory in
  the <a href="http://coq.inria.fr/">Coq proof assistant</a>.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The latest <b>stable</b> version is dated 2008-07-17.
    <ul>
      <li>Compatibility: Known to work with Coq 8.1pl3.</li>
      <li>Download: <a href="dists/metatheory-20080717.zip">metatheory-20080717.zip</a></li>
      <li><a href="changes.html">Change log</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Previous versions include the following distributions:
    <ul>
      <li>The first public release accompanied
        <a href="http://www.plclub.org/popl08-tutorial/">a tutorial at
        POPL 2008</a>.</li>
      <li>The second public release
        accompanied <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/oregon08/">a
        course</a> at the
        <a href="http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer08/">Summer
        School on Logic and Theorem Proving in Programming
        Languages</a> held at the University of Oregon in 2008.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation instructions</h2>

<ol>

  <li>Install an appropriate version of Coq according to the
    instructions distributed with it.  It should not matter whether
    you install a binary package or compile it from source.  In
    addition to the resources available through Coq's homepage, the POPLmark
    wiki also
    contains <a href="http://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~plclub/cgi-bin/poplmark/index.php?title=Installing_Coq">some
    tips on installing Coq</a>.</li>

  <li>Download the metatheory library distribution (see the link
    above).</li>

  <li>Unpack the zip file.</li>

  <li>To install the library globally:
    <ul>
      <li>Unpack the zip file and copy the resulting directory to some
        location within Coq's <code>theories</code> directory,
        e.g., <code>theories/metatheory</code>.  The exact location
        of <code>theories</code> will depend on how you installed
        Coq.</li>
      <li>Run <code>make</code> within the directory.</li>
      <li>You should now be able to import the library,
        e.g., <code>Require Import Metatheory</code>, without any
        other commands or options to Coq.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>The library can also be used locally by unpacking the zip file
    and copying all the <code>.v</code> files to the same directory as
    the Coq development with which you wish to use the library.
    Compile the library using the same means as you would to compile
    your development.</li>

  <li>Note that the distribution includes a <code>README.txt</code>
    file, and a <code>doc</code> directory that contains a copy of
    this web page and the HTML documentation linked to below.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The library is roughly divided into three parts: auxiliary
libraries, main libraries, and a library to pull everything
together.</p>

<h3>Auxiliary libraries</h3>

<p>Generic additions to Coq's standard library:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="html/AdditionalTactics.html">AdditionalTactics</a>:
  This library contains general purpose tactics that are not included
  with Coq.  The tactics for delineating cases in proofs are
  particularly useful since programing language metatheory typically
  contains inductive proofs with many cases.</li>

  <li><a href="html/ListFacts.html">ListFacts</a>: This library
  contains assorted facts about lists.  It is not specifically geared
  towards programming language metatheory, but the facts may be
  useful anywhere one uses lists in a development.</li>

</ul>

<p>Libraries that extend Coq's FSets library:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="html/FSetWeakDecide.html">FSetWeakDecide</a>: This
  library provides a decision procedure (as the
  tactic <code>fsetdec</code>) for solving goals about finite sets, as
  implemented by Coq's FSets library.  Some form of this library and
  tactic are likely to be included with Coq 8.2.</li>

  <li><a href="html/FSetWeakNotin.html">FSetWeakNotin</a>: This
  library provides a tactic <code>solve_notin</code> that solves
  particular forms of non-membership goals about finite sites.  This
  tactic is strictly less powerful than <code>fsetdec</code>.
  However, it seems to behave more predictably when used as a hint for
  Coq's <code>auto</code> and <code>eauto</code>
  tactics: <code>fsetdec</code>'s use of rewriting can interact poorly
  with existential variables in goals.  The tactic is intended to
  discharge the many freshness goals that appear in programming
  language metatheory.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Main libraries</h3>

<p>Support for names:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="html/Atom.html">Atom</a>:  This library provides an
  implementation of atoms, structureless objects with a decidable
  equality relation.  It is also possible to generate an atom fresh
  for a finite collection of atoms.</li>

  <li><a href="html/AtomSet.html">AtomSet</a>: This library provides
  an implementation of finite sets of atoms using Coq's FSets library.
  It also instantiates the finite set tactics provided by
  <a href="html/FSetWeakDecide.html">FSetWeakDecide</a>
  and <a href="html/FSetWeakNotin.html">FSetWeakNotin</a>.  Note that
  the tactics are named here as <code>atomsetdec</code>
  and <code>solve_atomset_notin</code>.  This library also defines a
  "<code>pick fresh</code>" tactic for generating an atom fresh for
  given finite set.</li>

</ul>

<p>Support for environments:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="html/AssocList.html">AssocList</a>: This library
  provides a functor which implements association lists, i.e., lists
  of pairs of keys and values, over a given type of keys.  It provides
  basic functions and predicates on association lists, as well as
  properties of those functions and predicates.  Association lists can
  be used to represent, for example, the environments that appear in
  programming language definitions.</li>

  <li><a href="html/AtomEnv.html">AtomEnv</a>: This library provides a
  signature for the functor
  in <a href="html/AssocList.html">AssocList</a> where the keys have
  been specialized to atoms.  Such association lists can be used to
  represent environments (a.k.a. contexts).  To reflect this fact,
  tactics whose names ended in "<code>alist</code>" now end in
  "<code>env</code>".  (Coq's module system does not require that
  tactics be defined identically in a module signature and its
  implementation.) <b>Note:</b> This library is automatically
  generated from <a href="html/AssocList.html">AssocList</a>.  As a
  result, some of the documentation may not quite fit.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Pulling everything together</h3>

<ul>

  <li><a href="html/Metatheory.html">Metatheory</a>: By design, the
  libraries above do not declare many hints or define many notations.
  The intent is for users to glue the libraries together in some
  fashion that suits their particular needs and preferences.
  The <a href="html/Metatheory.html">Metatheory</a> library provides a
  reasonable default combination of the libraries above.  In addition
  to declaring an assortment of hints and notations, it also defines a
  tactic for working with cofinite quantification.  Users of the
  metatheory library (as a whole) can simply <code>Require Import
  Metatheory</code> to get started on their developments.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Additional reading</h2>

<p>The metatheory library was originally developed to support the paper
  <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1328897.1328443">Engineering
  Formal Metatheory</a>.  (The link is to the ACM Digital Library.
  The paper is also available from the authors' homepages.)  The
  "<code>pick fresh and apply</code>" tactic, defined
  in <a href="html/Metatheory.html">Metatheory</a>, supports working
  with the cofinite quantification technique discussed in that paper.
  Aside from this, the library is potentially useful wherever one
  needs to work with atoms, finite sets, and association lists.</p>
