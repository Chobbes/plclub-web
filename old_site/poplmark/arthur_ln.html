    <p>This locally nameless formalization is the result towards which
      I have converged at the end of an internship focused on the
      POPLMark Challenge. The work took place from March to July 2006
      at the University of Pennsylvania, with Benjamin Pierce and
      Stephanie Weirich as advisors.</p>

    <p>This solution benefits from two nice properties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The proofs of the main results are short and simple to
        follow through: the arguments are mostly the same as in a paper
        proof.</li>
      <li>The machinery involved is rather intuitive (in the sense
        that it does not require the ingenuity needed with pure
        de-Bruijn indices), and in the same time it is not too heavy
        (this is probably not true of a representation fully relying
        on names).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Main aspects of the solution:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is based on a locally nameless representation. As usual
        with this representation, there are two substitutions
        involved: one for indices and another one for names.</li>
      <li>Environments are built as lists of bindings, but then used
        as sets of bindings. This makes the proofs simpler because we
        can "forget" about the ordering of the environment. We use
        this not only to capture weakening, but also to capture
        substitution in environment. A nice side-effect is that the
        narrowing lemma becomes an instance of the "preservation of
        subtyping through type substitution" lemma.</li>
      <li>In SA-all rule, the name introduced is not quantified as
        "exists X # E", nor as "forall X # E", but as "forall X not_in
        L", where L is an arbitrary list of names (note that L is
        introduced by the constructor SA-all, and is not a parameter
        of the relation). The interest of this quantification is that
        there is no need for a formal proof of equivariance: this
        SA-all rule works everywhere. (Remark: equivariance is still
        needed to show the adequacy of the universal quantification
        with respect to the existential one).</li>
      <li>All the subtyping rules have premises enforcing the
        well-formation of the arguments. Tanks to a special notation
        for this, it does not look too bad. The advantage is that
        symmetry are preserved, and it seems to simplify the
        proofs.</li>
      <li>Proofs by inductions on the size of types are replaced by
        proofs on the derivation of the well-formation relation, which
        are closer to the notion of "induction on the structure of a
        type".</li>
    </ul>

    <p>About the implementation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>At first sight, the source file is quite long (580
         lines). This is because there are a good numbers of
         definitions, and many lemmas. But then the total amount of
         proof is quite small. More precisely, Coqwc reports some 300
         lines of specifications and some 150 lines of proofs</li>
      <li>There are around 40 lemmas, but most of them have less than
        3 lines of proofs. Only 6 lemmas have more than 4 lines of
        proof, and together the lines of proofs of those 6 lemma add
        up to about 50 lines.</li>
      <li>Proof-search tactics are used extensively; as a result, only
        the key arguments appear in the proofs.</li>
      <li>Very few tactics specialized for this development are
        introduced. Thus the proofs are easy to follow and one does
        not need to learn the syntax of the tactic language to use the
        code.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Possible improvements in the solution:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For some reason, the proof-search tactic sometimes fail to
        solve some goals while we could expect it to do so. This is
        why some cases labelled "Case SA-arrow" have to be done by
        hand.</li>
      <li>Proofs of some lemmas dealing with well-formation could
        probably be simplified, or at least beautified.</li>
    </ul>
