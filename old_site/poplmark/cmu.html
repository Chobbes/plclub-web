    <p>The Twelf methodology (worlds, world subsumption, termination
      checking, etc.) can be a bit mysterious for the uninitiated -
      not only for writing proofs, but even for understanding the
      significance of what one is reading. Once past the steep part of
      the learning curve, though, it becomes pretty natural (or so it
      is claimed :-). The relative simplicity of the Twelf framework
      (compared, for example, to Isabelle) is pleasant: proofs are
      written in a fairly direct style, rather than being carried out
      by applications of mysterious and powerful tactics. The
      inability to reuse common structures like lists is annoying, but
      not prohibitively so.</p>

    <p> HOAS is mostly a big win, but occasionally poses conundrums
      that have to be worked around in clever ways (e.g., the problem
      of how to "isolate" a variable in the middle of the context,
      needed for the transitivity/narrowing proof).</p>

    <p>The choice of an alternative presentation of the evaluation
      relation, using congruence rules instead of evaluation contexts,
      provoked an animated discussion on the mailing list. There were
      some who felt that this constituted a significant departure from
      the specification; others felt that the congruence rule
      presentation was "obviously the same" as the one using
      evaluation rules. One lesson from this discussion is that the
      "adequacy gap" (i.e., the complexity of the adequacy theorem
      relating an LF formalization to its paper presentation) can be
      of variable size and reasonable people can differ on how big it
      can be before adequacy itself requires a formal proof. However,
      in practice, Twelf users report that they tend not to bother
      thinking about this sort of adequacy at all: rather, they
      formulate their definitions directly in LF.</p>

    <p>Summary: An impressive demonstration of Twelf's strengths on a
      problem for which it is very well suited. For problems that
      involve heavy use of variable binding and that fit well with
      what Twelf can do (all theorems have Pi-2 statements and their
      proofs proceed by purely syntactic induction over inductively
      defined structures), Twelf is clearly an excellent tool.</p>

    <p>In its current incarnation, the Twelf metatheory has some
      limitations (principally the restriction to Pi-2 propositions)
      that place certain sorts of reasoning beyond its scope. For
      example, logical relations arguments cannot be carried out
      (except via heavy encodings), and the status of coinduction is
      uncertain. Work on lifting these limitations is underway, but a
      usable system appears to be some way off.</p>
