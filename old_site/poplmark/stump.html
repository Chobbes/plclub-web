    <p>The thesis of this solution to the POPLmark challenge is that
      programming language meta-theory can be feasibly formalized, at
      least in some cases, using names to represent bound
      variables. There are two main advantages of using names for
      bound variables. First, the representation of terms is more
      faithful to the official syntax of the language. Papers
      describing languages with bound variables, and tools
      implementing such languages, typically support an input syntax
      with named variables. Internally they may change representations
      of terms, but externally they support named variables. Hence,
      any formal meta-theory done with a representational technique
      like de Bruijn indices applies directly just to a possible
      internal representation of terms, not to terms as officially
      supported. Second, representing bound variables using names
      avoids the tedious technical complexities often associated with
      de Bruijn indices. It is perhaps believed that those
      complexities are to be preferred to the complexities associated
      with bound variables, for example those arising from the
      definition of capture-avoiding substitution. The present
      solution aims to show that at least in some cases, such
      complexities can be tamed, yielding an approach with similar or
      perhaps less technical tedium than de Bruijn indices.</p>
